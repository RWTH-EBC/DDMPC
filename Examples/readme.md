# DDMPC - Example Library
Here you can find working examples for the ddmpc package.

- **BopTest**:
  - **bestest_hydronic_heat_pump**: Hydronic Heat Pump example from BopTest framework ([documentation](https://ibpsa.github.io/project1-boptest/testcases/ibpsa/testcases_ibpsa_bestest_hydronic_heat_pump/)) using two separate predictors to predict the room temperature and the energy consumption. Selectable process models are ANN, GPR, linReg and physics based modeling.
- **FMUs**:
  - **ashrae**: Ashrae example using two separate predictors to predict the room temperature and the heat flow of the AHU. Selectable process models are ANN, GPR and linReg
